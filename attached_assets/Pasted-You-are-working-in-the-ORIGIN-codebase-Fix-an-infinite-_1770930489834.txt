You are working in the ORIGIN codebase. Fix an infinite retry loop in the onboarding system.

HARD REQUIREMENTS
- NON-DESTRUCTIVE.
- Fix must prevent hammering the server.
- Must handle missing workspace context gracefully.
- Must keep auth + tenancy rules intact.
- Update docs after change.

SYMPTOM
Frontend is repeatedly calling onboarding endpoints (/api/onboarding/state and/or /api/onboarding/recompute) in a tight loop.
Those endpoints fail because there is NO workspace context, and the frontend keeps retrying endlessly.

TASKS

1) Identify the loop source in the frontend:
- Search for onboarding fetch logic (React Query, fetch in useEffect, polling, refetch intervals).
- Find any retry configuration or effect dependency causing repeated refetch on error.
- Fix so onboarding state fetch does NOT retry endlessly.

2) Add explicit error handling rules:
- If response indicates missing workspace context (e.g. 400/409 with code WORKSPACE_CONTEXT_REQUIRED, or 403 with message), then:
  a) STOP retries
  b) Navigate user to a Workspace Selection route (or dashboard route that forces workspace selection)
- If 401 unauthorized: navigate to /login
- Only allow limited retries for transient errors (network/5xx). Cap retries (e.g. max 2) with backoff.

3) Ensure workspace context is established before onboarding calls:
- Add a guard in the onboarding page/screen:
  - If no current workspace is selected in client state, call an endpoint to fetch available workspaces.
  - If exactly 1 workspace, auto-select it (set context via whichever mechanism the app uses: cookie/header/store).
  - If multiple, route to workspace picker UI.
  - If none, route to workspace creation flow.

4) Server improvements for clearer signaling:
- In requireWorkspaceContext middleware (or onboarding routes), if workspace context missing, return a consistent error:
  - status 409
  - body: { error: { code: "WORKSPACE_CONTEXT_REQUIRED", message: "Workspace context required" } }
- Ensure onboarding endpoints are behind requireAuth AND requireWorkspaceContext, but now produce this explicit error shape.

5) Add a safety fuse:
- Add a rate-limit or debounce in the client to prevent rapid repeated calls even if a bug reappears (e.g. disable refetching while in error state).

6) Docs:
- Update /docs/ONBOARDING_SYSTEM.md to document:
  - required workspace context
  - error code WORKSPACE_CONTEXT_REQUIRED
  - frontend behavior when missing workspace context
