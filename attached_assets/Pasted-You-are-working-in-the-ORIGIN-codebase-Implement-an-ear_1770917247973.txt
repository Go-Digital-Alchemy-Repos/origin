You are working in the ORIGIN codebase. Implement an early-stage “Webflow-like” Editor UI shell and design primitives so future builder/CMS work inherits the same premium interface.

HARD REQUIREMENTS
- NON-DESTRUCTIVE: do not remove existing features. Prefer new files + minimal wiring.
- Inter font must be used everywhere in Admin + Editor UI.
- Create a reusable 3-pane EditorShell layout:
  - Left Rail: tabs (“Add”, “Navigator”) + search input stub
  - Center Canvas: top toolbar + scrollable canvas container
  - Right Rail: tabs (“Style”, “Settings”, “CMS”) + property sections stub
- Use consistent tokens for spacing/radius/shadows/borders/focus rings.
- Keep implementation framework-agnostic to the rest of the app (works whether the canvas is Puck or custom).
- Add a feature flag ORIGIN_EDITOR_SHELL=true. If false, route continues to old editor.
- Add lightweight transitions (150–200ms) to hover/focus/active states.
- Provide clean, premium UI (like Webflow/Figma): subtle borders, proper empty states, consistent padding.

STEP 1 — Audit + Plan
- Identify current Admin layout components and styling approach (Tailwind? CSS modules? shadcn/ui? custom?).
- Identify where Inter is set; if missing, add it globally.
- Identify existing editor routes/pages and where to mount the new shell.

STEP 2 — Add design tokens
- Create a single source for UI tokens (choose the best fit: CSS variables file, Tailwind config extensions, or a theme module).
- Tokens must include:
  - --bg, --panel, --panel2
  - --border, --border2
  - --text, --muted
  - --accent (use ORIGIN blue), --accent2
  - spacing scale (4/8/12/16/24)
  - radius scale (8/12/16)
  - shadow scale (subtle panel shadow)
  - focus ring (consistent)
- Ensure dark-friendly neutral palette; editor should look premium on light background by default unless the app is dark-mode.
- Apply tokens to base elements and form controls.

STEP 3 — Build UI primitives (reusable components)
Create components (or equivalents in your stack):
- <Panel> (header + content)
- <PanelHeader> (title + right actions slot)
- <Tabs> (small, Webflow-like)
- <ScrollArea> (nice scrollbars, consistent)
- <Section> (collapsible optional, but at least a consistent section block)
- <FieldRow> (label + control)
- <IconButton> and <Button> with consistent sizes
- <SearchInput> (stub)
All components must use the same spacing + border + typography rules.

STEP 4 — EditorShell layout
Create <EditorShell /> that renders:
- LeftRail: Tabs (“Add”, “Navigator”); each shows placeholder content; include a search input at top.
- Center:
  - TopToolbar with:
    - page name dropdown stub (“Home”)
    - breakpoint buttons (Desktop/Tablet/Mobile) stub
    - undo/redo disabled buttons stub
    - Preview/Publish buttons stub
  - CanvasContainer:
    - centered “page frame” with max width, subtle background, and safe padding
    - show an empty state card: “Drop components here” if no content
- RightRail: Tabs (“Style”, “Settings”, “CMS”), each with placeholder sections and form fields.

STEP 5 — Interaction overlay (visual only for now)
- Add a CanvasOverlay layer component (position: absolute) that can render:
  - hover outline (fake demo box)
  - selection outline (fake demo box)
  - resize handles (visual only)
- Gate it behind a boolean so it can be enabled later by actual selection logic.

STEP 6 — Wire into app behind a flag
- Add env var ORIGIN_EDITOR_SHELL or config flag.
- If true, route /admin/editor (or current editor route) loads the new EditorShell with your existing editor/canvas injected into the center area (or placeholder if not ready).
- If you already have a builder, mount it inside CanvasContainer.

STEP 7 — Performance hygiene (early)
- Avoid heavy re-renders:
  - memoize LeftRail/RightRail
  - keep canvas content in its own component boundary
- Ensure scrolling is smooth.
- Ensure no layout shift when switching tabs.

STEP 8 — Documentation
- Add an Admin Docs Library entry: “Editor Shell (Webflow-like UI)”
  - Explain layout, tokens, primitives, feature flag, and where to extend.
- Note TODOs: undo/redo, real navigator tree, real style manager, CMS bindings.

OUTPUT
- Provide:
  - a list of created/modified files
  - how to enable ORIGIN_EDITOR_SHELL
  - screenshots not required, but describe where to navigate to see it
  - any follow-up TODO recommendations
