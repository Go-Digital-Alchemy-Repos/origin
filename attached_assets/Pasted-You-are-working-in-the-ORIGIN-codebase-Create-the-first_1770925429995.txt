You are working in the ORIGIN codebase. Create the first 3 “Onboarding Eligible” Site Kits and wire them into the onboarding flow and marketplace catalog.

HARD REQUIREMENTS
- NON-DESTRUCTIVE: do not remove existing features. Add new files + minimal wiring.
- Must use the existing ORIGIN design tokens/primitives and the new EditorShell system for previews where appropriate.
- Site Kits must be safe: installing a kit must NOT overwrite existing pages/content; it should create new pages/templates/sections unless user explicitly applies changes.
- Site Kits must be Marketplace items with flexible billing rules (free/trial/paid) controllable from Platform Studio.
- Must update BOTH: Developer Docs Library + Client Resource Docs.

CONTEXT
We already have:
- Marketplace framework + installs + preview sessions
- Platform Studio
- Pages + builder (EditorShell)
- Themes (site tokens + layout presets)
- Menus
- Forms
- SEO defaults system
- Onboarding wizard step “Choose Site Kit”

GOAL
Create 3 premium starter Site Kits (high quality, modern, clean SaaS style) that cover common agency client categories:
1) Contractor / Home Services
2) Professional Services
3) Restaurant / Hospitality

Each kit must include:
- Theme preset: light + dark tokens + layout presets (header/footer styles)
- Pages (created as ORIGIN Pages with builder JSON):
  - Home
  - About
  - Services (or Menu for restaurant)
  - Contact
- Menus:
  - Header menu (Home/About/Services(or Menu)/Contact)
  - Footer menu (Contact + Privacy placeholder)
- Forms:
  - Contact form (prebuilt) and embedded into Contact page
- SEO defaults:
  - site-level defaults (title suffix, default OG image placeholder, robots policy)
  - page-level SEO fields populated with reasonable placeholders
- Sections:
  - 8–12 polished section presets per kit (hero variants, feature/service grids, testimonials, CTA, FAQ, gallery, map/location, etc.)
- Marketplace previews:
  - Provide preview thumbnails and a “Preview Kit” experience using EditorShell canvas or a hosted preview route that uses the kit’s theme and page JSON.

BILLING / PRICING MODEL (FLEXIBLE)
Implement billing config on the marketplace item so each kit can be:
- free
- trial
- one-time
- subscription add-on
This must be editable later in Platform Studio WITHOUT code changes.

Add fields (or ensure they exist) on marketplace_items metadata:
- is_onboarding_eligible (boolean)
- is_featured (boolean)
- billing_type ("free" | "trial" | "one_time" | "subscription")
- trial_days (optional)
- stripe_price_id (optional)
- entitlement_key (optional, usually null for kits)
- display_badge (e.g. "Free", "Included", "Premium", "Trial")

INITIAL SETTINGS (for now)
Set all three kits to:
- is_onboarding_eligible = true
- is_featured = true
- billing_type = "free" (BUT must be editable later in Platform Studio)

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

STEP 1 — Data model + catalog wiring
1) Ensure Site Kits exist as first-class records in Platform Studio:
- site_kits table (name, version, status, metadata)
- site_kit_assets table (references theme preset, pages, sections, menus, forms)
2) Ensure a marketplace_items entry exists per kit with type="site_kit" and links to site_kits.id.

STEP 2 — Create the three Site Kits
For each kit, create:
A) Theme preset (light/dark tokens + layout presets)
B) Section preset pack (8–12 presets) using global component registry
C) Pages (builder JSON) that use the section presets
D) Menus wired to pages
E) Contact form wired to Contact page
F) SEO defaults and per-page SEO fields

Kits:

1) "ORIGIN Starter Kit — Contractor / Home Services"
Sections recommended:
- Hero: “Fast, reliable service in {City}”
- Services grid (3–6)
- Before/After gallery section (placeholder images)
- Testimonials
- Service area / map section
- FAQ (with schema support later)
- CTA band “Request a Quote”
- Contact form section

2) "ORIGIN Starter Kit — Professional Services"
Sections recommended:
- Hero + credibility highlights
- “What we do” services list
- Team/leadership section
- Case studies highlights
- Testimonials
- FAQ
- CTA “Book a Consultation”
- Contact form section

3) "ORIGIN Starter Kit — Restaurant / Hospitality"
Sections recommended:
- Hero with reservation CTA
- Menu highlight sections (categories)
- Gallery
- Hours + location
- Testimonials
- Events/announcements (simple)
- CTA “Order / Reserve”
- Contact form / inquiries

All page copy can be placeholder but should be polished and realistic.

STEP 3 — Installation behavior
Implement a safe “Install Site Kit” handler that:
- Creates pages if they do not exist (namespaced slugs like home/about/services/contact)
- Applies theme preset ONLY if user chooses “Apply Theme” (respect existing Theme Preview + Apply flow)
- Adds section presets to the site’s available presets library (site-scoped list referencing global registry presets)
- Creates menus if missing
- Creates contact form if missing
- Does NOT overwrite existing pages; if slug conflict exists, create a suffixed slug and notify user

STEP 4 — Onboarding integration
Update onboarding “Choose Site Kit” step to:
- query marketplace_items where type="site_kit" AND metadata.is_onboarding_eligible = true AND status="published"
- show badge based on billing_type/display_badge
- allow Preview
- allow Install (free) or Purchase (if paid in future)
- after install, advance wizard step and open EditorShell on Home page

STEP 5 — Marketplace UI integration
In Marketplace:
- add category "Site Kits"
- list these 3 kits with thumbnails, description, preview, install/purchase controls

STEP 6 — Platform Studio management
In Platform Studio:
- Site Kits manager should allow:
  - editing metadata (description, tags, industry)
  - toggling is_onboarding_eligible
  - toggling billing_type (free/trial/paid) and setting trial_days/stripe_price_id
  - publishing/deprecating the kit
  - version bump with changelog
- Ensure changes reflect in Marketplace without redeploy.

STEP 7 — Preview system
Implement “Preview Site Kit” that:
- does NOT modify the user’s site
- renders a preview site/page using:
  - kit theme tokens
  - kit page JSON
- Use EditorShell preview mode if it exists, otherwise add a simple preview route/page.

STEP 8 — Documentation
Developer docs:
- /docs/SITE_KITS_STARTER_PACK.md
  - kit composition structure
  - install behavior (non-destructive rules)
  - how to add a new kit
  - how pricing/billing toggles work
Resource docs:
- Add client-facing entries:
  - “Choosing a Site Kit”
  - “Installing a Site Kit safely”
  - “Previewing themes and kits”
Add in-app Docs Library entries for both.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
At the end, provide:
- list of created/modified files
- DB tables/columns added
- routes/endpoints added
- where to see the 3 kits in Platform Studio and Marketplace
- how to test onboarding: create site → choose kit → install → open EditorShell → publish
- TODO recommendations (short)
